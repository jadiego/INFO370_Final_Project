# Analyzing Adaptation Success of Second Generation Immigrant Children of America

Historically, immigrants arrive in America for various reasons - some immigrate to escape political persecution, and some immigrate due to economic opportunities. Arriving in a new country, these families go through an adaptation process.
To explore the success of second wave immigrant we looked at two specific aspects - Their success in terms of professional careers they achieve at an older age, and family income based on the parents contribution only. Below are the three specific questions we seeked to analyze.

1. How does the parentâ€™s educational, work, and language background affect family income?

2. Does speaking english give greater mobility to family?

3. How does the previous relationships(1 and 2) look like if we were to view it from the perspective of the Hmong and Vietnamese?
